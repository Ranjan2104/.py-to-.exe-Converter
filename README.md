# .py to .exe Converter
 py2exe is a Python extension which converts Python scripts (.py) into Microsoft Windows executables (.exe). These executables can run on a system without Python installed.[3] It is the most common tool for doing so.  py2exe was used to distribute the official BitTorrent client (before the version 6.0) and is still used to distribute SpamBayes as well as other projects.  Since May 2014, version 0.9.2.0 of py2exe is available for Python 3.[1] Before then, py2exe was made only for Python 2,[4] and it was necessary to use an alternative like cx_Freeze for Python 3 code
